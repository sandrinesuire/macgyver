Help MacGyver to escape !
===========================

Short description of this project
---------------------------------

A 2D maze in which MacGyver is locked. The exit is supervised by a guard. To distract him, you need to gather the 
following elements (scattered in the labyrinth): a needle, a small plastic tube and ether. 
They will allow MacGyver to create a syringe and lull our guard into sleep.

* The game window is a square of 15 squares.
* MacGyver retrieve an object simply by moving on it.
* MacGyver wins if he shows up in front of the guardian with all the objects, if he misses objects he dies.
* The program must be standalone, that is it can be run on any computer.
